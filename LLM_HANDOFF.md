# Preflight LLM handoff

This file is a route to current state, not a copy of it.

Before changing code or collecting release evidence:

1. Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
2. Fetch `main`, list the open PRs in the area, and read the live
   [release board #652](https://github.com/teamleaderleo/preflight/issues/652).
3. Read [Release readiness](docs/release-readiness.md).
4. Follow the current owner. [#965](https://github.com/teamleaderleo/preflight/issues/965)
   owns candidate exercises, [#818](https://github.com/teamleaderleo/preflight/issues/818) owns
   final package identity, [#418](https://github.com/teamleaderleo/preflight/issues/418) owns the
   packaged startup benchmark, and [#1023](https://github.com/teamleaderleo/preflight/issues/1023)
   holds product observations until one becomes a concrete defect.
5. Read [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) before driving the game. Use
   `scripts/benchmark-startup.sh` for one automatic startup measurement, `--details` to explain a
   changed result, and `--campaign` only for a real comparison.

The current development/public startup headline is **~101s → 13.69s**. Do not substitute a median,
the old 89.00s → 15.53s A/B pair, or another campaign statistic unless the maintainer explicitly
changes the headline. Runs measured with the same startup clock are observations of the same elapsed
time. Campaign statistics exist to answer comparison/attribution questions, not to rank which
startup observation is allowed to represent the development result.

Private signing rehearsals prove that the release machinery works. They are not final release
evidence. Final operator evidence must use the same selected tag, source, Distribution, and package
generation throughout. A source change creates new bytes and invalidates affected package evidence.

Use [the engineering chronology](docs/next-llm-handoff.md) and dated
[evidence](docs/evidence/) when implementation history is relevant. Never take a SHA, owner, or
priority from historical notes without checking the live repository first.
